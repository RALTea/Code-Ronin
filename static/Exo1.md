# A Brand new (Hello) World

Welcome to your first JavaScript exercise! We'll start with the classic "Hello, World!" program. This simple exercise will help you understand how to write and run a basic JavaScript command.

## Exercise Instructions:

1. Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element".
3. Look for a tab called "Console" and click on it.
4. In the console, you'll see a prompt where you can type JavaScript code.
5. Type the following line exactly as shown:

   ```javascript
   console.log('Hello, World!');
   ```

6. Press Enter to run the code.

## What to Expect:

If you've typed the code correctly, you should see "Hello, World!" appear in the console.

## Explanation:

- `console.log()` is a JavaScript function that prints (or "logs") a message to the console.
- The message "Hello, World!" is enclosed in quotes because it's a string (a piece of text).
- The semicolon (`;`) at the end marks the end of the statement.

## Challenge:

Try changing "Hello, World!" to a different message. What happens when you run the code again?

Congratulations! You've just written and run your first JavaScript code!
